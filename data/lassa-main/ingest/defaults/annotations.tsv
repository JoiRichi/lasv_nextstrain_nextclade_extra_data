# Manually curated annotations TSV file
# The TSV should not have a header and should have exactly three columns:
# id to match existing metadata, field name, and field value
# If there are multiple annotations for the same id and field, then the last value is used
# Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments
# Any '#' after the field value are treated as comments.
